# UWB-nRF52840-DWM3000
Ultrawideband communication on the DWM3000. Code written for the nRF52840 board, specifically the Seeed Studio Xiao breakout. Code is a combination of ports from the Qorvo DWM SDK and other projects

Devlopment is in partnership with Adom Inc. The first milestrone of this project is reliable two way ranging (TWR) communication. This project should culminate in 3-4 UWB modules being able to communicate over TWR simlultaneously to demonstrate 2D/3D positioning.
